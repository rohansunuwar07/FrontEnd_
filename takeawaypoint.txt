   Frontend

   html => structure the webpage
   css  => is used to beautify 
   react => is used to deals with data


   Image = always place image in public folder 
    . in src of image tag always points the public folder



    Component: 

        component are function whose first letter is always capital and it is called just like calling tag. <Home></Home>  

        component must return only one wrapper.
        <></> => it is called react fragment.

        use {} (curly braces) to perform javascript operation inside tag (+,-,*,/, variable call, map,filter)

        component are custom tag


    anything that is written inside return of component are printed(displayed) on the browser


Routing:  => changing path

    NavLink change the url
    Routes give component based on url


    localhost:3000/blog?name=ram&age=20

    url: route ? query or search string

    route: route parameter(blog)
    query: (name, age)

    anything before ? is called route
    anything after ? is called query string or search string

    here blog is called route parameter and name, age are called query parameter

        1.  useParams : to get dynamic route parameter
        2.  useSearchParams : to get query parameter
        3.  useNavigate : to change path on click event
